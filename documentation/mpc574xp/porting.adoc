This document details all the steps to port the trampoline RTOS to the MPC574xP platform.

The OSEK compatibility for the first one being implemented followed by the AUTOSAR compatibility layer.

All the test have been done on the "DEVKIT-MPC5744P" available on NXP's website.

== Understanding the OSEK specifications
OSEK is a static RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) developed for the automotive industry by French and German OEMs.

OSEK can manage tasks (some might be interrupted), event, alarms, resources (shared or not) all while providing a safety level compliant with the industry due to its static aspect.
There are limits to the OS depending on it conformance class.

|=== Events
Events are defined by the two following attributes

|===
| Attribute | Type | Description

| NAME | STRING | Name of the attribute as defined in the OIL file descriptor

| MASK | UINT64 | A mask used to differentiate attributs among them +
Only one bit must be set to 1 in the mask +
The value 0 is forbidden
|===

An event can be used by more than one task. Each task using events must have them being defined in the OIL file.

== Converting from PowerPC ISA to VLE
ldw => e_ldw
stw => e_stw

Removing the use of intrinsics, because we do not know if the compiler will support them.

=== VLE restriction on registers
Because of the 16 bits encoding of the instructions, all GPR registers are not accessible from those instructions.
Only GPR0-GPR7 and GPR24-GPR31 can be accessed.
Moving data between the laternate registers and the registers used in 16 bits instructions is done via the mtar and mfar instructions.



== Understanding the OIL parser
The OIL parser generates lists of objects which are filled with the inform√πations conatined in the OIL file.

Once the file has been parsed, a set of scripts are used to generate all the source, compiler and linker files.

=== OIL main script
The main script is located in the "trampoline/goil" directory and is called "root.goilTemplate".

The following paragraph describes the algorithm's steps to generate the OS files based on teh content of the OIL file.

==== OIL algorithm
Here is the steps used by the algorithm to generate the OS files.

. Determine the OS version (AUTOSAR or OSEK)
. Check some vsion specific elements
. Initialize objects list
. Launch a verification script
. Build IOC dataset
. Compute some generic flags
. Compute many AUTOSAR variables (right now OSEK only)
. Build the TASKS list and set its attributes
. Build the ISRS list and set its attributes
. Build the RESOURCES list and set its attributes
. Concatenate the TASKS, ISRS and RESOURCES lists into a single one (PRIORITIZED)
. Sort the PRIORITIZE list bu ascending PRIORITY attribute
. Reassign objects priorities (From 1 to ..)
. Compute different data related to processes and resources

OIL files contains either OSEK or AUTOSAR OS description information.

The script determines which kind based on the OIL_VERSION value, the variable AUTOSAR is created based on this version.

The following table gives a summary of the versions.

.Table OS Versions
|===
| OS_VERSION | Kind of OS

| 2.5 | OSEK
| 3.1 | AUTOSAR
| 4.0 | AUTOSAR
|===



The script will then build lists of objects using the content extracted from the OIL file.

To ease the process, the scripts check all lists and creates an empty one if the information is not in the OIL script.

The following list are used in the scripts:

* APPMODE
* TASK
* ISR
* EVENT
* COUNTER
* ALARM
* RESOURCE
* MESSAGE
* APPLICATION
* SCHEDULETABLE
* IOC
* TRANSACTION
* OBJECT
* SPINLOCK

===== TASKS list and attributes definition
The script is adding several attributes to each task.

* PRIORITY
* UNSEINTERNALRESOURCE
* CORE (for multicore configuration)
* KIND ("Task", amongst "Task" or "ISR")

Priority assignment is done the following way:

- The priority 0 is reserved for the IDLe task.
- The initial priority is multiplied by two to manage resources' priorities.

The formula to calculate the priority is 2*OIL(PRIORITY) + 1.

PRIORITY is of type UINT32 and consequently in the range [0 .. 2^32^ - 1].

The calculated priority is in the range [1 .. 2^33^].

So the maximum value for a task priority is 2^31^-1.

The distance between to calculated values is always 2:

- (2 * (n + 1) + 1)  - (2 * n + 1) = 2n + 3 - 2n - 1 = 2

So there is always an available priority number available for a resource.

Usage of internal resources is determined by checking the RESOURCEPROPERTY attribute of each resource used by the task.

There should only be one internal resource per task.

The script is setting the USEINTERNALRESOURCE and INTERNALRESOURCE (resource's name) to the task.

If the task is non-preemptable, it cannot have an internal resource.

The SCHEDULE attribute of a task determines whether it is pre-emptable or not.

A non-preemptable task will have the INTERNAL_SCHEDULER_STRUCT assigned as an internal resource.

The name of the scheduler resource is "INTERNAL_RES_SCHEDULER".

Finally the KIND attribute with the value "Task" is added to each task object.

At the end, all task objects in the TASKS list will have been initialized, the resource scheduler added (if used) and the task_max_priority calculated.

===== ISRS list and attributes definition
The script builds a list of ISRs in the ISRS list.

A priority is defined with the following constraints:

- The priorities of the ISRs must be higher than the Tasks' priorities
- Some space must be reserved to manage resources' priorities

The two attributes which are set are PRIORITY and KIND ("ISR")

As we are using the same formula to calculate the ISR's piority, we should also check the boundaries and the calculation and the value of the task_max_priority.

Moreover the priority of an ISR is always greater than the priority of a task.

===== RESOURCES list and attributes definition
For each resource, build the list of the tasks and isrs that are using the resource.

The assigned priority is the highest priority of the processes that are using the resource to which we add 1.

===== Compute different data related to processes and resources
The script extract the following informations from the data

.Table Data set by the script
|===
| Data | Definition

| PRIO2
| List of Tasks, Resources and ISRs sorted ascending with priority reattribution starting with priority 1.

| MAX_JOB_AMONG_PRIORITIES
| Contains the maximum number of tasks per priority (including the nunmber of activations)

| NUMBER_OF_PRIORITIES
| Number of priorities used for tasks, resources and ISRs

| READY_LIST_SIZE
| Contains the tasks, ISR, and Resource (including the number of activations for each task)

| BASICTASKS
| Contains all the basic tasks of the system

| EXTENDEDTASKS
| Contains all the extended tasks of the system (compatible with the WaitEvent mechanism)

| TASKS
| List all the tasks in the OS, basic and extended

| PROCESSES
| List all the processes in the SO, basic  and extended tasks, plus ISR of category 2

| highest_priority_task_uses_resource
| Contains the highest task's priority that is using a resource

| OS::RESSCHEDULERPRIORITY
| Stores the highest task priority, it will be used to set the scheduler resource priority (+1)

| RESOURCES
| Contains all the resources sued by the OS

| ISRS1
| List of ISR of category 1

| ISR2
| List of ISR of Category 2

| CORES[n]
| Contains two attributes, TASKS and ISRS which respectively lists all the tasks and ISRs assigned to each core. If there is only one application, only the core numbered 0 is used.

| HARDWARECOUTNERS
| List all the counters with attribute "TYPE" equals to "HARDWARE" and also counters without the "TYPE" attribute.

| SOFTWARECOUNTERS
| List all the counters with attribute "TYPE" equals to "SOFTWARE"

| USEREVENTS
| List of all the events with an integer MASK attribute. +
When assigning automatic event mask and generating list opf events per task the script is checking that two different events with the same mask are not assigned to a single task. +
The mask value "0" is also forbidden by the standard.

| AUTOEVENTS
| List of all the events without a defined mask

| tasks_for_event
| Creates a map of events and assign for each event a list of tasks using it
